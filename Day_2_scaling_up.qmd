# Introduction

In this session, we will look at strategies to scale up our analyses. How do we get R to repeat tasks in an efficient way? This session will be a mix of live coding and challenges. 

We will be using the {tidyverse} packages to help us with this. We will also be using the {penguins} dataset, which is a collection of data on penguin species from Antarctica. The dataset includes information on individual counts, species, and other relevant variables.

Why do we need to scale up?

A common challenge: Repeating things

- split, apply, combine
- Abstraction 
  - What are inputs, outputs, common process

Several tools that can help us apply this workflow

- tidyverse: tables, group_by, summarise/mutate (Will)
  - start wiuth table, then split , apply, combine
- ggplot: facets (Will)
- refresh: lists, vectors, tables, --> things to split (Will)
- map: for lists / vectors (Aniko)
- functions (Dan)
- nest (Dan)


## Load libraries

We will primarily be using packages from the {tidyverse}, feel free to add more packages here to help solve the challenges.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
dir.create("output")
```


## Challenge 0 - Loading data from many files

We have just returned from an expedition from Anatarcia and collected *a lot* of data from multiple species of penguins. Sometimes "we" counted the penguins.  Sometimes we didn't.  We recorded data for each species in separate `.csv` files but **we need to combine these into one large dataframe for analyses. How can we do this programmatically?**

pathway <- list.files(path = "data/penguins/", pattern = ".csv", full.names = TRUE)

# purrr::map() option
penguins_data <- pathway |> purrr::map_df(read_csv)

# base R lapply() option
penguins_data_1 <- pathway |> lapply(read_csv)

# penguins_combined[[1]]

```

```


## Challenge 1 - Import common names

We only have latin names for each species of penguin but we need common names for when we report our results to stakeholders. Our collaborator started compiling common names in a separate `.csv` in the `data/` folder. **Compile the common names for the remaining taxa and join these into the dataframe `penguins_combined`. You may need to import the `penguins_combined.csv` into R first. 

In words, describe what are the steps to solve the challenge: 

- need same names
- dyplyr "_join"

penguins_combined <- left_join(penguins_data, existing_data,
                               join_by(verbatimScientificName == scientific_name))

penguins_combined_1 <- left_join(penguins_data, existing_data,
                               by = c("verbatimScientificName" = "scientific_name"))

```

```

## Challenge 2 - Add n_records as a column

For your analysis, you need to calculate the total number of records available for each species, and add that as a new column in your data.

In words, describe what are the steps to solve the challenge: 

- row length of each species
- add value to dataset as a new column
-

```{r, learner-solutions}

penguins_combined <- penguins_combined |>
                          group_by(species) |>
                          mutate(individuals = length(species)) |>
                          ungroup()

# alternatives:
nrow()
count()
length()
summarise()

# existing table > adds column
group_by() |> mutate()

# new dataset > makes a new column
group_by() |> summarise()

```

## Challenge 3 - Determine the top 3 most recorded taxa

We need to know which are the top 3 species that we have the the most records. Can you figure which species are these?

In words, describe what are the steps to solve the challenge: 

- sort data into descending order

```{r, learner-solutions}

penguins_combined |> distinct(species, individuals) |> arrange(desc(individuals)) |> slice(1:3)

# alternatives:
sort(individuals, decreasing=T)

# if you have the data
head(existing_data[rev(order(existing_data$common_names)),],3)

penguins_counts |> arrange(desc(individuals) |> slice(1:3)
                           
top <- penguins_combined |> distinct(species, individuals)
top[1:3,]

```

Demonstrator solutions: 

```{r, instructor-solutions}

```


## Challenge 4 - Excluding rogue data

We need to clean the data a little before we analyse it. Clean the data so that we have

- Individual counts > 0
- Observations from iNaturalist and eBird using the `institutionCode` (the code for eBird is confusingly "CLO"; the code for iNaturalist is more sensibly "iNaturalist")

Export this dataset as a `.csv`

penguins_combined |> filter(individuals > 0, str_detect(occurrenceID, "inaturalist|CLO" )) |> write.csv("data/penguins_id.csv")

```

## Challenge 5 - Add Size information

We need to get compute the average bill and flipper dimensions using the `penguin_sizes` data and merge this into the `penguins_combined` dataset. You name need to wrangle/create the penguin names a little

In words, describe what are the steps to solve the challenge: 

- filter bill and flipper dimensions from dataset
- compute averages for overall dimensions
- add averages into dataset

```{r, learner-solutions}

# read in data
penguin_sizes <- read_csv("data/penguin_sizes.csv")

# filter bill and flipper dims, exclude NAs, calc averages
penguin_dim <- 
  penguin_sizes |>
  select(species, bill_length_mm, bill_depth_mm, flipper_length_mm) |>
  filter(!is.na(bill_length_mm)) |> 
  group_by(species) |>
  summarise(avg_bill_length = mean(bill_length_mm),
         avg_bill_depth = mean(bill_depth_mm),
         avg_flipper_length = mean(flipper_length_mm)) |> 
  # rename species names
  mutate(species = paste0(species, " penguin"))


# add to original dataset
penguin_combined_2 <- left_join(penguins_combined, penguin_dim,
                                by = join_by(common_name == species))

```

## Challenge 6 - Export data by year

Your collaborator at the museum requires the giant penguin dataset to be broken down and saved as `.csv` by year. Solve this challenge with code!!

In words, describe what are the steps to solve the challenge: 

- separate dataset into years
- save each year dataset as a csv file

Try solving this in R using new skills:

```{r, learner-solutions}

# by year
penguin_combined_2 |> arrange(desc(year)) |> View()
penguin_combined_2 |> group_by(year) |> purrr:map_df(write.csv()) |> write.csv("data/")
split_1 <- split(penguin_combined_2, penguin_combined_2$year) |> write.csv()
    
# save as csv
# write_path <- file.path("Users",
# "giselenour", "Documents", "UNSW", "Stats_Central", "2025_R_intermediate_code", "data")

year_data <- penguin_combined_2 |> group_by(year) |>
  group_split()

year_names <- unique(penguin_combined_2$year)

write.csv(year_data, file = year_names, ".csv")

mutate(year_names = paste(year_names, ".csv")


for (i in 1:length(df_split)) {
    assign(new_names[i], df_split[[i]])
    filename = paste(new_names[i], ".csv")    # change here
    write.csv(df_split[[i]], filename, row.names = FALSE)}


# SOLUTION 1
# create directory
dir.create("ouput/by_years", recursive=TRUE, showWarnings=FALSE)

# for loop

# SOLUTION 2
# using map2 or walk2
map() --> returns a list
walk2() --> list, yearnames)


```

## Challenge 7 - How much do different penguin species migrate

Your penguin collaborator knows from natural history knowledge that some penguins migrate and others don't but no one has ever quantified this.  Calculate the difference between the summer median latitude and the winter median latitude for each species.  (Median is more robust to outliers so that's more appropriate here compared to the mean.) Note there may be species with missing data for certain seasons and this may lead to missing species in the final plot. 

Make a plot of species by degrees latitude migrated.

## Challenge 8 - Lots of descriptive statistics

We need to report on some descriptive statistics of our penguin study. We need to know the following:

- How many different genera are represented in our dataset
- How many different species do we have for each genera
- Calculate the proportion of points from iNaturalist and eBird using the institutionCode (the code for eBird is confusingly "CLO"; the code for iNaturalist is more sensibly "iNaturalist")
- How many records by species
- How many records by year
- How many records by country code
- How many records by basis of record

## Challenge 12 - Fit lots of models

In your analyses, sometimes you need to fit one complex model, other times you might be fitting many seperate models. How do we do that efficiently?

You been asked to fit a linear model between log_count and latitude, for each speces. Fit the models and extract the r2 for each model fit.
